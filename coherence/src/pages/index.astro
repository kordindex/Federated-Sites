      title: 'What does "Coherence" actually mean? The vocabulary takes time to grok.',
      description: 'Coherence is about alignment between what you say (broadcast) and what people actually experience (reality). Narrative Debt = the gap between those two. Temporal Stewardship = intentional pacing instead of reactive urgency. We developed a new vocabulary because standard management language was already failing. Our job is to teach it to your team until it becomes second nature. That typically takes 2–4 weeks of consistent use.',
    },
    {
      title: 'How is this different from executive coaching or leadership training?',
      description: 'Traditional executive coaching focuses on individual skill-building. Leadership training is curriculum-based skill development. We do neither. The Coherence Protocol diagnoses where your organization is losing momentum, then operationalizes fixes into policy. Individual coaching makes one person better. The Coherence Protocol makes your team move faster together.',

      title: 'How long until we see results?',
      description: 'Immediate: The Coherence Assessment (5 minutes) shows your baseline. Short-term (1–2 weeks): Decision velocity improves. Medium-term (30 days): 21% innovation recovery, 47% decision speed improvement. Long-term (90+ days): Culture change sticks. The protocols become how you operate.',

      title: 'What if we are not ready to commit to a full program?',
      description: 'Start small. Take the Coherence Assessment (5 minutes, free). If it resonates, book a 15-minute consultation with a steward. Most leaders who see their baseline score opt into the 30-Day Pilot. The typical sales cycle is 1–3 weeks from first conversation to decision.',

      title: 'Is everything we discuss confidential?',
